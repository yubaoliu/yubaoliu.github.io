202112-202412, **Staff Engineer, Samsung Research**, Beijing, China

XR VST HMD development, SLAM, Loop Closure and re-localization,  Nerf with SLAM, 3D Gaussian Splatting with SLAM, RAG and Robotics

[XR CES Demo](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/cn/events/ces-2024)

201608-201809, **Senior Software Engineer, iSoftStone Information Technology(Group)Co.,Ltd.**, Beijing, China

Cooperate with Lenovo Research Center, develop PC AR OST HMD

**Project**: **Personal Computing Augmented Reality (AR) Glass Development**, 1.5 years

Develop lightweight AR glass (small size, light weight, suitable for personal PCs), which is for office use. It is more competitive than others. The prototype of it has completed. What I am responsibled mainly includes:
* **IMU**: use IMU to estimate the pose of AR glass, evaluate and make decision for IMU algorithms：IMU and magnetic sensor calibration, data fusion. Design tracking demo use IMU in Unity3D.

* **Tracking**: in order to locate the original poit of 3D world, proceed target recognition or marker tracking using OpenCV, EasyAR, Kudan, Wikitude, and Vuforia

* **SLAM**: SLAM solution selection and application development using ORB Slam, DSO, Vuforia extended tracking, EasyAR, and Kudan SLAM

* **Native SDK**: firmware on STM32 MCU is programed with C and the SDK（talk with firmware）on Windows is programed with CPP, and the SDK offers API called by Unity3D C#.

* **GUI HCI design**: C# control panel for monitoring and controlling AR glass hardware, adjust parameters of IMU, Camera, Sensors and upgrade firmware version

* **Unity3D AR** main program is programmed in Unity3D with C#, including glass tracking demo using IMU, Vuforia extended tracking and some other SLAMs

- **Window System Service**: AR glass plug and play using C#

**Project**: **Python Spider**, 2 Months
Proceed python spider in the aid of Scrapy, Xpath, Regular Expression(RE) to grap data like user comments, articles. And then save these data to database (eg.MongoDB) to conduct further data analysis.

**Project**: **Voice Meeting Software**, 2 Months
To develop a Windows APP for voice meeting. Evaluate and verify the possible technologies and write demo codes(C# WPF) for:
- hardware device plug and play on Windows
- record mic device and do voice translate
- record sound card device and do voice translate
Voice engigen is implemented in the aid of Baidu/KeDaXunFei voice engine, etc..

**Project**: **Little Toy Robot**
To develop a comany robot, equiped with simple face expression identification and voice recognition using Raspberry Pi, Linux, Python.
