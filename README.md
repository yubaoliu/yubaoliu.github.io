## Work Experience

---

201608-201809, **Senior Software Engineer, iSoftStone Information Technology(Group)Co.,Ltd.**, Beijing, China

Cooperate with Lenovo Research Center, and proceed project development and academic research.

**Project**: **Personal Computing Augmented Reality(AR) Glass Development**, 1.5 years

Develop lightweight AR glass (small size, light weight, suitable for personal PCs), which is for office use. It is more competitive than others. The prototype of it has completed. What I am responsibled mainly includes:
* **(Inertial Measurement Unit) IMU**: use IMU to estimate the pose of AR glass, evaluate and make decision for IMU algorithms：IMU and magnetic sensor calibration, data fusion. Design tracking demo use IMU in Unity3D.

* **Tracking**: in order to locate the original poit of 3D world, proceed target recognition or marker tracking using OpenCV, EasyAR, Kudan, Wikitude, and Vuforia

* **(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)SLAM**: SLAM solution selection and application development using ORBSlam, DSO, Vuforia extended tracking, EasyAR, and Kudan SLAM

* **Native SDK**: firmware on STM32 MCU is programed with C and the SDK（talk with firmware）on Windows is programed with CPP, and the SDK offers API called by Unity3D C#.

* **GUI HCI design**: C# control panel for monitoring and controlling AR glass hardware, adjust parameters of IMU, Camera, Sensors and upgrade firmware version

* **Unity3D AR** main program is programmed in Unity3D with C#, including glass tracking demo using IMU, Vuforia extended tracking and some other SLAMs

- **Window System Service**: AR glass plug and play using C#

**Project**: **Python Spider**, 2 Months
Proceed python spider in the aid of Scrapy, Xpath, Regular Expression(RE) to grap data like user comments, articles. And then save these data to database (eg.MongoDB) to conduct further data analysis.

**Project**: **Voice Meeting Software**, 2 Months
To develop a Windows APP for voice meeting. Evaluate and verify the possible technologies and write demo codes(C# WPF) for:
- hardware device plug and play on Windows
- record mic device and do voice translate
- record sound card device and do voice translate
Voice engigen is implemented in the aid of Baidu/KeDaXunFei voice engine, etc..

**Project**: **Little Toy Robot**
To develop a comany robot, equiped with simple face expression identification and voice recognition using Raspberry Pi, Linux, Python.

* Keyword: AR HMD glass, Computer Vision, SLAM, Unity3D/c/c++/C#, Android/Linux

---

201506-201606, **Software Engineer, Intel China Research Center Ltd. IT FLEX**, Beijing, China

Imaging, Computer Vision; USB (USB3 and XHCI) Pre-silicon verification; Perl/Python/shell scripts with regular expression

* **USB Pre-silicon Verification**: cooperate with Folsom, California USA Team to debug and validate USB and XHCI new features in the next generation CPU (e.g. ice lake) via reviewing USB3 and XHCI specification again and again and writing functional coverage and test cases using system Verilog for validation on USB simulation platform based on Linux

* **Automotive scripts and apps**: text processing with regular expression and writing scheduled automation programs; grepping useful message from larger files quickly and automatically; wring automotive scripts using Perl/Python/Shell to generate Verilog or c/cpp source code using predefined format

* **Computer Vision for Intelligent Robot**: cooperate with Intel Lab to do code optimization for smart robot which can follow people through detecting human via Real Sense Camera

* Keyword: Real Sense Camera, Visual Studio, C/C++/Perl/Shell/Python/System Verilog, Cmake, OpenCV, Linux, ace, Emacs, Regular Expression
